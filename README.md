The market trend of veterinary industry is to maintain growth at 6.2% a year.
In the US, one key indicator — the number of visits to veterinary clinics by pet and livestock owners — has fallen recently. This probably resulted from a combination of decreasing affordability and the availability of information online. According to the American Pet Products Association, 43% of dog owners and 41% of cat owners rely on online information.
In the US, consumer spending on domestic animals is forecast to reach $33 billion in 2014, according to research from Freedonia. Pet health product demand at the manufacturer level is expected to rise almost 6 percent yearly to reach $5.5 billion in 2014.

3)Number of lost consultantions due to travel expenditures Dogs(30%), cat(25%).
4)Keep your clients happy and earn extra money by providing after hours care through TeleVet.
5)Veterinarians are receiving texts, emails, and phone calls regularly from friends and family wanting to know how to help their pets. Since vets are awesome, they often respond to these with how best to help. Unfortunately, these interactions are unmanaged, not monetized, and lacking records.
